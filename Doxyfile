# Doxyfile 1.8.8

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.
#
# All text after a double hash (##) is considered a comment and is placed in
# front of the TAG it is preceding.
#
# All text after a single hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
# The format is:
# TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists, items can also be appended using:
# TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (\" \").

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Project related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

# For config item PROJECT_NAME, default is My Project
PROJECT_NAME           = libfunctionality

# For config item OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, default is 
OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = doxygen


# The STRIP_FROM_PATH tag can be used to strip a user-defined part of the path.
# Stripping is only done if one of the specified strings matches the left-hand
# part of the path. The tag can be used to show relative paths in the file list.
# If left blank the directory from which doxygen is run is used as the path to
# strip.
#
# Note that you can specify absolute paths here, but also relative paths, which
# will be relative from the directory where doxygen is started.
# This tag requires that the tag FULL_PATH_NAMES is set to YES.

# For config item STRIP_FROM_PATH, default is 
STRIP_FROM_PATH        =  \
                         src

# The STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH tag can be used to strip a user-defined part of the
# path mentioned in the documentation of a class, which tells the reader which
# header file to include in order to use a class. If left blank only the name of
# the header file containing the class definition is used. Otherwise one should
# specify the list of include paths that are normally passed to the compiler
# using the -I flag.

# For config item STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH, default is 
STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH    = src
# If you use STL classes (i.e. std::string, std::vector, etc.) but do not want
# to include (a tag file for) the STL sources as input, then you should set this
# tag to YES in order to let doxygen match functions declarations and
# definitions whose arguments contain STL classes (e.g. func(std::string);
# versus func(std::string) {}). This also make the inheritance and collaboration
# diagrams that involve STL classes more complete and accurate.
# The default value is: NO.

# For config item BUILTIN_STL_SUPPORT, default is 0
BUILTIN_STL_SUPPORT    = YES

# If the EXTRACT_LOCAL_CLASSES tag is set to YES classes (and structs) defined
# locally in source files will be included in the documentation. If set to NO
# only classes defined in header files are included. Does not have any effect
# for Java sources.
# The default value is: YES.

# For config item EXTRACT_LOCAL_CLASSES, default is 1
EXTRACT_LOCAL_CLASSES  = NO
# Default value for CASE_SENSE_NAMES omitted

# If the SHOW_GROUPED_MEMB_INC tag is set to YES then Doxygen will add for each
# grouped member an include statement to the documentation, telling the reader
# which file to include in order to use the member.
# The default value is: NO.

# For config item SHOW_GROUPED_MEMB_INC, default is 0
SHOW_GROUPED_MEMB_INC  = YES

# If the SORT_MEMBER_DOCS tag is set to YES then doxygen will sort the
# (detailed) documentation of file and class members alphabetically by member
# name. If set to NO the members will appear in declaration order.
# The default value is: YES.

# For config item SORT_MEMBER_DOCS, default is 1
SORT_MEMBER_DOCS       = NO

# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
# directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with
# spaces.
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.

# For config item INPUT, default is 
INPUT                  = src \
                         README.md


# The RECURSIVE tag can be used to specify whether or not subdirectories should
# be searched for input files as well.
# The default value is: NO.

# For config item RECURSIVE, default is 0
RECURSIVE              = YES

# If the USE_MDFILE_AS_MAINPAGE tag refers to the name of a markdown file that
# is part of the input, its contents will be placed on the main page
# (index.html). This can be useful if you have a project on for instance GitHub
# and want to reuse the introduction page also for the doxygen output.

# For config item USE_MDFILE_AS_MAINPAGE, default is 
USE_MDFILE_AS_MAINPAGE = README.md

# If the SOURCE_BROWSER tag is set to YES then a list of source files will be
# generated. Documented entities will be cross-referenced with these sources.
#
# Note: To get rid of all source code in the generated output, make sure that
# also VERBATIM_HEADERS is set to NO.
# The default value is: NO.

# For config item SOURCE_BROWSER, default is 0
SOURCE_BROWSER         = YES

# If the GENERATE_LATEX tag is set to YES doxygen will generate LaTeX output.
# The default value is: YES.

# For config item GENERATE_LATEX, default is 1
GENERATE_LATEX         = NO

# If you set the HAVE_DOT tag to YES then doxygen will assume the dot tool is
# available from the path. This tool is part of Graphviz (see:
# http://www.graphviz.org/), a graph visualization toolkit from AT&T and Lucent
# Bell Labs. The other options in this section have no effect if this option is
# set to NO
# The default value is: NO.

# For config item HAVE_DOT, default is 0
HAVE_DOT               = YES
