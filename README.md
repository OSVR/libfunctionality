-------

Please use `clang-format` to keep the code tidy. The `.clang-format` 
config file is in the root of the repository. We're basically using the 
LLVM style, except with 4-space indentation and C++03 (since turning on 
C++11 in `clang-format` sometimes makes things not work in 
less-compelling compilers) 

If you're using Windows, please install a recent [llvm/clang 
binary][llvmwin], and choose to add the directory to the path. (Makes it 
easier.) If you've got a non-Express version of Visual Studio, you might 
also want the clang-format plugin. In either case, there are a pair of 
scripts in `/devtools/`: 

- `format-project.cmd` runs `clang-format` in place using wildcards to 
    hopefully grab every file. 

- `format-file.cmd` runs `clang-format` in place on whatever file or 
    files you drop on it - useful if you want some other code to also look 
    in the same style.
