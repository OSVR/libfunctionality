# libfunctionality
> Maintained at <https://github.com/OSVR/libfunctionality>

A minimal library for dynamically-loaded or statically-linked functionality modules, which we call **plugins**. What you do with them and how you interact with them is your business. How you load them is ours.

Designed to factor out the nitty-gritty of plugin loading, entry points, and dynamic loading vs. systems that only support static linking (like iOS).

See the CONTRIBUTING file for coding guidelines.
